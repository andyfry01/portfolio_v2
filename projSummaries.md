### What I like

## HBC-SLBA
### Description
A redesign of a business website with an outdated, unresponsive design. Developed in a very short timeframe to dovetail the release of the site with the announcement of new partners in the company. The goals at the outset of the project were to make it mobile-friendly and to cut out complexity to make the site easy to navigate and relevant information easy to find.  
### Tech
JS/HTML5/CSS3, jQuery, Navigo, Babel, Flexbox, Bootstrap 4, SVG.
### Etc
The client previously had a static site consisting of many individual pages with lots of repeated code (menus, footers, etc). He wasn't interested in Wordpress or any kind of CMS, and wanted to keep the ability to still go into the HTML to edit content directly, while I wanted to improve the structure of the site by eliminating all of the repeated code. I did this by breaking the site down into HTML snippets arranged into section-specific directories, and spun up a custom single page app architecture consisting of Navigo for routing and jQuery's load method for inserting each HTML snippet when its route is loaded.
