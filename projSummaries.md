## Basix Student
### Description
Basix Student is a service that university students can use to get discounted medical care through their student health insurance programs. The scope of the project involved a complete rebuild of the site to improve both the site design and user experience, and the creation of a dashboard app to make site updates easier for the client.
### Tech
React, React Router, Redux, Webpack, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, SVG, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, AWS, JS/HTML5/CSS3, regular expressions.
### What I like
I like that the redesign has been a holistic improvement overall for both the client and the users. Navigating the site and finding the info you need is easier, the look is more modern, and the dashboard has given the client a much better ability to make site updates, saving time and money!

## HBC-SLBA
### Description
A redesign of a business website with an outdated, mobile-unfriendly design. Developed in a very short timeframe to dovetail the release of the site with the announcement of new partners in the company. The goals at the outset of the project were to make it mobile-friendly and to cut out complexity to make the site easy to navigate and relevant information easy to find.  
### Tech
JS/HTML5/CSS3, jQuery, Navigo, Babel, Flexbox, Bootstrap 4, SVG.
### What I like
The client previously had a static site consisting of many individual pages with lots of repeated code (menus, footers, etc). He wasn't interested in Wordpress or any kind of CMS, and wanted to keep the ability to still go into the HTML to edit content directly, while I wanted to improve the structure of the site by eliminating all of the repeated code. I did this by breaking the site down into HTML snippets arranged into section-specific directories, and spun up a custom single page app architecture consisting of Navigo for routing and jQuery's load method for inserting each HTML snippet when its route is loaded.

## Geotube
### Description
GeoTube was my final project at General Assembly. Many YouTube videos have geolocation metadata attached to them, but YouTube itself only offers a limited ability to search for or use this data. GeoTube hooks up the YouTube data API with Google Maps to offer users an easy way to search for videos by geographical area
### Tech
### What I like
There's so much interesting content out there on YouTube, but the ways that you typically search out video content are relatively limited. You can search by name and filter results by certain parameters, but that's basically it. I really like that GeoTube offers users a new paradigm for performing searches and gives you a different perspective on the vast wealth of videos out there in the world.

## Citibike Navigator
### Description
The CitiBike Navigator brings together two things that CitiBike users in New York need: directions between the starting and ending points on their ride, and the closest CitiBike docks to those points with available bikes and docking slots. Using Google Maps and the CitiBike data API, users can get both of these things combined into a one stop shop service!
### Tech
CitiBike Data API, Google Maps, Handlebars, JS, HTML5, CSS3
### What I like
I like that the CitiBike Navigator brings together two critical pieces of functionality into a seamless, user-friendly interface. You need to know where you're going and where you're going to pick up and drop off your bike when doing a CitiBike trip, and the CitiBike Navigator takes away the guesswork in locating docking stations and flipping back and forth between apps to plan your trip.
